## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS

I created the mirror of the New York Times website using HTML and CSS. I used media queries to make the site responsive and made the appropriate content decisions to improve user experience from large to small screens. 

## Lessons Learned

In this project, I learned how to use media queries to remove content from a webpage for proper content decisions suchs are removing ceratin Li's when the webpage shrinks to a certain size.
